   \section*{Trust and Ethics for AVs}
   One of the most important things in the study of ethics is its defintion. Instead of using the defintion supplied in the paper, I will define ethical behavior as the following:   
   \begin{quote}
      \emph{Ethical behavior is behavior that while not always for the better for the individual is beneficial for society as a whole.}
   \end{quote}
   While this is a flawed defintion, I will use it as I disagree with the one given and believe that utilitarianism would be better for AI purposes. Everything after this will be based on that opinion.

   The paper defines four different definitions for 
   \begin{quote}
      \emph{(SN-0) A robot (or AI or AV) will never harm a human being.}
   \end{quote}
   
   \begin{quote}
      \emph{(SN-1) A robot will never deliberately harm a human being.}
   \end{quote}

   \begin{quote}
      \emph{(SN-2) In a given situation, a robot will be no more likely than a skilled and alert human 
      to accidentally harm a human being.}
   \end{quote}

   \begin{quote}
      \emph{(SN-3) A robot must learn to anticipate and avoid Deadly Dilemmas. }
   \end{quote}
