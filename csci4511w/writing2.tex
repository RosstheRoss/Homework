   \section*{Theta*}
   This paper is about a modification of the $A^{\ast}$ algorithm that is dubbed $\theta^{\ast}$.
   The paper is proposing a new algorithm by building on a previous one and altering it for other conditions.
   Theta$^{\ast}$ modifies A$^{\ast}$ by allowing A$^{\ast}$ where any vertex can be the parent of any other vertex, compated to A$^{\ast}$ where the only successors allowed are the direct parents of the node.
   The differences can best be demonstrated when there are obstacles in the grid. This is demonstrated in the paper as obstacles in a video game.
   In the paper, the authors validate the algorithm with experiments involving small grids, large grids, and maps from the CRPG Baludr's Gate II.
