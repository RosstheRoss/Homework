  ABSTRACT  = {Yuhanna b. Mansur b. Sargun (ca. 655–ca. 749 C.E.), better known as John of Damascus, lived through the cultural transition from Late Antiquity to Early Islam and thus offers an important window into the practice of Late Antique Christian faith in a changing cultural milieu.John’s family is traceable to at least two generations of prominent Arab Christians. His grandfather, Mansur b. Sargun, and his father, Sargun b. Mansur, were both among the educated elite of Damascus and participated in the Umayyad Muslim government that was then headquartered at Damascus (Sahas 1992, 187). It is thought that John’s grandfather},

  ABSTRACT  = {It was the year 726. The Christian West was blanketed with petty kingdoms that battled with one another for political supremacy while the Christian East was evaporating at an alarming rate. Within a matter of decades, Byzantium had lost much of its kingdom to Arab invasions in the Middle East, including three of its most historic Christian centers—Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. The Muslim Umayyad Dynasty was intent on overtaking Constantinople to prove itself the undisputed ruler of the East. The Christian people of Byzantium fretfully wondered why God would allow their land to be taken by Muslims while the},

  ABSTRACT  = {This overview covers the main trends and events that affected the development of the Byzantine Empire, or Byzantium, from the 4th to the 15th centuries.¹ Byzantium was the ancient name of the empire’s capital city, Constantinople (contemporary Istanbul) (Fig. 3). The term was adopted by historians of the 18th century to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire and distinguish it from its western part. The inhabitants of the region would not have recognized the name Byzantium. They saw themselves as Romans, citizens of the Roman Empire, which was reshaped in the East with the adoption of Christianity and the influence},

  ABSTRACT  = {Iconoclasm, literally ‘the breaking of icons’, is one of the few Byzantine words still in English and European use. This itself is testimony to the lasting power of the conflict which it names: the fight over the dangers and powers of religious images. In Byzantium, iconoclasmwas inspired by the Second Commandment of the Law of Moses, which states: ‘Thou shalt make no graven images nor shalt thou worship them.’ The recapitulation of this law in the Book of Deuteronomyis even more severe:Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven},
