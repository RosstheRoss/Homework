The term was adopted by historians of the 18th century to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire and distinguish it from its western part. The inhabitants of the region would not have recognized the name Byzantium. They saw themselves as Romans, citizens of the Roman Empire, which was reshaped in the East with the adoption of Christianity and the influence},

  abstract  = {Iconoclasm, literally ‘the breaking of icons’, is one of the few Byzantine words still in English and European use. This itself is testimony to the lasting power of the conflict which it names: the fight over the dangers and powers of religious images. In Byzantium, iconoclasmwas inspired by the Second Commandment of the Law of Moses, which states: ‘Thou shalt make no graven images nor shalt thou worship them.’ The recapitulation of this law in the Book of Deuteronomyis even more severe:Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven},

The Muslim Umayyad Dynasty was intent on overtaking Constantinople to prove itself the undisputed ruler of the East.
