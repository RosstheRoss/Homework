\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}

The purpose is to provide a description for the Sports League Administration Manager (SLAM). It will explain the purposes, features, interfaces, and designed use cases for the system. This is intended for both the Minneapolis Parks and Recreation Board and the developers of the service.

\section{Document Conventions}

This Document made to comply with the IEEE Software Requirements Format.

\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This document is designed to be read by the developers creating and maintaining SLAM, the administrators at the Minneapolis Parks and Recreation Board, and the athletes, league administrators, coaches, and other interested parties.

\section{Project Scope}
SLAM will be used by Minneapolis Municipal Parks and Recreation to organize sports leagues throughout the city. The system will provide methods for creating, managing, and administering sports leagues as well as assign officials. The system will also allow coaches to create teams and add players to teams.

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{diagram} \\

The Sports League Administration Manager is developed to organize a 
$<$Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.  
For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product 
family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained 
product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the 
requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and 
identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major 
components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external 
interfaces can be helpful.$>$

\section{Product Functions}
$<$Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user 
perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary 
(such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them 
understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of 
related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram 
or object class diagram, is often effective.$>$

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
The system is divided into four users: administrators, officials, coaches, and the public. The roles are defined below.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Administrators:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Create and manage leagues
        \item Create and manage league and tournament schedules 
        \item Generate user statistics on demand
        \item Assign officials to leagues and games
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Administrators include Staff members and the Parks and Recreation Organizer.  They have the highest privilege level. Administrators are the ones in charge of creating leagues, scheduling games, and assigning officials. They also are the users that create statistics and deal with finances.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Officials:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Submit their availability to official games
        \item Accept or reject games to officiate
        \item View the schedule of games they need to attend
        \item Submit scores when game is complete
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Officials are responsible for submitting scores when games are over. They also are responsible for submitting their schedules so all games played have a sufficient number of officials.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Coaches:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Create teams
        \item Add athletes to teams
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Coaches are responsible for creating teams and adding athletes to teams.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Athletes, the Public:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item View schedule
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Athletes and other end users need to be able to view the schedule of games they plan on attending or playing in.

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

It is assumed that an external database and interface already exist.

\chapter{System Features}

\section{League Creation}

\subsection{Description and Priority}
The system shall allow administrators to create leagues for sports. The system will list sports to create a league for and the user will select the sport. The system will then list the leagues that are available for the sport and the user will select the league.

\subsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
A user must be logged in as an administrator to be able to create a league. The user submits the sport they want to create a league for and the system will respond by verifying the response and creating a new league if the response is valid.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
REQ-101: The system shall list all sports that leagues can be created for. \\
REQ-102: The system shall validate the user input. \\
REQ-103: The system shall return an error if the user tries to create a league for a sport that does not exist or is no longer allowing league creation. \\
REQ-104: The system shall create the league after verifying the input. \\
\indent Valid sports are as follows: Sand Volleyball, Kickball, Indoor Soccer, Softball, Outdoor Soccer, Tennis, Flag Football, Fall Soccer, Dodgeball, Indoor Volleyball, Fall Kickball, Fall Softball, Basketball, Broomball, and Pond Hockey.
